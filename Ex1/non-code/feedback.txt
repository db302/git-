Exercise 1:
	Correct, nothing to complain about.

Exercise 2:
	You don't need a swap method in python.
	You can simply swap element of a list via tuples.
	(a, b) = (b, a)
	The right side is evaluated before the assignment is done.
	So you buffer both values of a and b at the same time in a tuple.
	After this both variables get the opposing values assigned.
	This even works with lists: (lst[i], lst[j]) = (lst[j], lst[i])
	Even the braces can be omitted due to automatic packing of Python:
	lst[i], lst[j] = lst[j], lst[i]

	So (lst[i+1-j], lst[i-j]) = swap(lst[i+1-j], lst[i-j]) simplifies to
	lst[i + 1 - j], lst[i - j] = lst[i - j], lst[i + 1 - j]

	Because Python works with automatic memory management you don't need to
	delete your variables. (Opposing to C / C++)
	But you can use "del" to delete items from a list / map:
	del lst[5]

	Nevertheless, good job.
	Nothing to complain about.
