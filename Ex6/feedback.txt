Clean solution with nothing to complain about.

Python tip:
	With python 2 it works fine out of the box. If you use python 3 then
	the integer division is done by using the "//" operator. The
	"index < len(self._list)/2" evaluates under Python 3 to a floating point
	number which breaks the assumption about the existing left child (child_1).
	The result is an IndexError (IndexError: list index out of range) for one
	of the tests. If the code should run under both environments an
	explicit cast helps:

	if len(self._list) > 1 and index < int(len(self._list)/2):

	or you can simply use the defined operator:

	if len(self._list) > 1 and index < len(self._list)//2:

Don't hesitate to ask if you need help or something is unclear.
