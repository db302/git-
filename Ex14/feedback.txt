compute_ed_via_table: Correct. Great work.
	You simplified the calculation by using the assumption that only
	the diagonal replacement determines the costs of each operation.

	You can use the min function with more than two arguments to calculate the
	minimum of the values. This simplifies the calculation even further:
	table[i][j] = min(delCosts, insCosts, replCosts)

	min(iterable[, key])
	min(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])
	"Return the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more
	arguments."

Don't hesitate to ask if you need help or something is unclear.
