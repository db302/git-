If you measure the runtime of an algorithm don't output the length of each
operation since writing to the disk will nearly always be slower than the
operations to measure. With this you will add noise to the graph which
"blurs" the expected result. Take "samples" after a given amount of steps.
This will reduce the file-size and the runtime of your measurement.
See the folder example for an implementation and the resulting plots.

About the "unexpected behavior of one of the last data points":
Since I don't see an unexpected datapoint I guess you mean the legend of the
diagram. In case you have never seen one you can read this:
