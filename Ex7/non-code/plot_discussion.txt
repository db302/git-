The incrase of the time in function of the number of operation should be continous.
In all plots there is an unexpected behavior of one of the last data points.
It is not possible, that an remove or append operation has a biger accumulated execution time then the operation n+1
There might be an issue by measuring the execution time with timeit...
I tried to find this datapoint in the data file. I searchd around the 9200000 operations, but didn't manage to find it.
It might be somewhere completly unexpected.
