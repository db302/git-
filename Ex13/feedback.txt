compute_lcc:
	You should copy the list of nodes since you are removing the elements
	from the list:

	uncheckedNodes = self._nodes[:]

You need to implement the "less than" comparator for the queue to work:

	class Node:
		def __lt__(self, other):
			return self._distance < other._distance

compute_shortest_paths: OK
	If you correct the line 262 you will receive the distance of
	331765m ~= 331km which is correct:

	print(g._nodes._distance[4435496]) -> print(g._nodes[4435496]._distance)

Don't hesitate to ask if you need help or something is unclear.
