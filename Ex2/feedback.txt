Exercise 1:
	Correct, but care about the order of your resulting terms.
	A clear "solving direction" should be visible.
	-> See PDF

Exercise 2:
	Correct

Exercise 3:
	You could simplify your repair_heap method by using a temporary variable
	containing the index of the element to be swapped:

		swap_index = start_index

		# swap the smaller element
		if l_child_index < heap_size and lst[swap_index] < lst[l_child_index]:
			swap_index = l_child_index

		if r_child_index < heap_size and lst[swap_index] < lst[r_child_index]:
			swap_index = r_child_index

		# we need to swap a child
		if swap_index != start_index:
			repair_heap(lst, swap_index, heap_size)

	Have a look at the module timeit since it provides a simple interface to
	time code snipplets.

	"What is the difference between '' and ""?"
	From the python 3 documentation:
	https://docs.python.org/3.1/reference/lexical_analysis.html
	#string-and-bytes-literals

	"In plain English: Both types of literals can be enclosed in matching single
	quotes (') or double quotes ("). They can also be enclosed in matching
	groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally referred to
	as triple-quoted strings). The backslash (\) character is used to escape
	characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline,
	backslash itself, or the quote character."

	So there is basicly no difference.
	Other programming languages use '' as a delimiter for single characters
	while "" is used for strings.
